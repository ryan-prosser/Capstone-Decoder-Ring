<h3>Caesar Shift</h3>
<p>
   The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally
   used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military
   significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting"
   letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic
   order.

<h3>Polybius Square</h3>
<p>
  The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a
  typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through
  a coordinate. For example, in the above table, the letter "B"
  would be represented by the numerical pair "21".
</p>
<h3>Substitution Cypher</h3>
<p>
                  The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a
                substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will
                be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires
                that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it
                will be difficult for them to decode the message.
